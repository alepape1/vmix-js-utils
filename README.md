# vmix-js-utils
Javascript utilities for communicating with vMix web API.

The utilities consists of several modules. Each can be used on its own, but usually it makes more sense to make it interplay with some of the other modules.
The modules is as following:
 - Connection - Let you define which vMix endpoint you want to receive and send to (Normally it is something like http://localhost:8088/api)
 - StateFetcher - Fetches the current state of the vMix instance
 - CommandSender - Sends commands to the vMix instance ApiDataParser
 - InputMapper - Maps the inputs from the vMix instance state to JSON objects
